The Senate whispers in the Forum but the baker shouts prices louder than the orator. I stood among the crowd as a tribune promised justice yet all I saw were merchants weighing figs and citizens measuring the dust in their purses. Wine flows cheaper than water yet the tavern-keeper waters the wine and calls it divine. Bread is dearer each morning and the crowd grows restless in front of the ovens. The aqueduct carries blessings from the hills and sings louder than the priests in their temples. A soldier returns from the frontier boasting of victory though his purse holds no coin and his sandals fall apart on the cobbles. Children chase dogs through the market, their laughter louder than the rhetoric of senators. My neighbor swears the gods have turned their eyes from us because his olive jars cracked in the heat. The augur reads entrails and declares fortune yet I read the tax scroll and see only doom. My brother swears by Mars in public and whispers to Venus in the dark. The baths are full of gossip, sandals vanish and words echo longer than the steam. In the palestra men wrestle, in the caldarium men argue, in the frigidarium they plot politics. A scribe scratches curses on the wall and I scratch my name beside his, hoping some stranger centuries hence will know we lived. The mosaic in my atrium insists my villa belonged to a consul though my roof leaks when it rains. A baker speaks more sense than an orator especially when the loaves are warm. The gods accept incense yet demand oil, and oil costs more than silver this season. Tomorrow the circus promises lions today the street promises beggars. I saw a senator walking in purple yet begging secretly for a loan in whispers. Garum flows in amphorae down the alley and my wife curses the smell as if Neptune himself had spoiled the sea. The Forum hums with voices, petitions, accusations, promises, laughter and curses. A man sells amulets claiming Apollo blessed them though the bronze is cheap and the cord frays. A poet recites verses near the temple steps but no one listens except a drunk leaning on the column. The legion drums echo from the camp and boys march in step pretending to be centurions. A fortune-teller throws knucklebones and tells a woman she will live long; the woman coughs and shakes her head. The baths resound with splashing, gossip, secrets; a magistrate lowers his voice while the merchant raises his. My neighbor quarrels about olives while his wife quarrels about wine. My cousin waits three days for trial and the tribune proclaims justice is swift. The circus banners wave in the wind, painted with lions and heroes. Boys carve their names on walls and soldiers carve theirs on shields. The augur waves his staff toward the east, declaring favor, yet the clouds gather black and heavy. My sandals wear thin from pacing the Forum listening to promises that crumble like plaster. A farmer brings figs from the countryside and says the gods blessed his orchard though half the crop spoiled on the road. A priest prays loudly but counts his coin more quietly. A gladiator parades through the street, armor gleaming, yet his eyes are tired and hollow. The crowd cheers lions, cheers chariots, cheers victory, cheers anything to forget hunger. Wine flows, garum drips, oil burns, incense smokes. The empire stretches beyond the horizon yet in my street the potholes swallow wheels. My wife burns offerings to Juno while the neighbor curses Mercury for stealing his luck. The baker curses the miller, the miller curses the farmer, the farmer curses the weather. A sailor returns from Ostia and speaks of storms, pirates, gods, taxes, and always the price of grain. In the Forum I heard ten men boast of loyalty and twenty men accuse their rivals. A senator argues about law while his slave argues about chickens. In the baths I lost my ring, in the market I lost my purse, in the circus I lost my voice. The augur tells me the gods smile but the tax collector tells me otherwise. My neighbor carves a statue of Hercules from wood because marble costs too much. The shoemaker promises sandals that will last a lifetime but the straps snap in a week. A poet dreams of eternity but owes money to every tavern. Children chalk pictures on the stones of the street and rain washes them away by night. A soldier shows scars as proof of valor but hides the wound that festers beneath his armor. A merchant swears by Neptune that his fish is fresh though the smell tells otherwise. The baker says flour is short but his storeroom bulges. The senator says the people are content but the people shout in the Forum. A priest pours wine on the altar, a drunk pours wine on himself, both stumble by dusk. The aqueduct arches rise higher than any promise made in the Senate. A man carves dice from bone and swears they always fall in his favor. A beggar sings in the shadow of the temple and collects more coin than the priest inside. The amphora breaks, the oil spills, the crowd curses, the merchant curses louder. A mother prays to Isis for her son, a soldier prays to Mars for his general, a debtor prays to Mercury for escape. The baths smell of steam and sweat, the temples smell of incense and oil, the taverns smell of smoke and vinegar. A senator whispers to his client, the client whispers to his creditor, the creditor whispers to the gods. My brother speaks of philosophy but gambles on dice with more faith than in reason. A fisherman swears the Tiber gives him gifts but his boat leaks. The cobbler curses nails that bend, the blacksmith curses fire that dies, the farmer curses rain that never falls. Chariots thunder in the circus and the dust rises like incense to the crowd. My name is written on a wall beside a curse and beside a poem; perhaps both are true. Garum stains my tunic but bread stains my purse. The gods watch, or they sleep, or they laugh.
The Senate whispers in the Forum but the baker shouts louder than the consul. My neighbor quarrels about olives, his wife quarrels about wine, their child quarrels about sandals that no longer fit. The aqueduct arches rise against the sky, carrying water that tastes of stone and blessing. A soldier boasts of battles beyond the mountains though his wounds are small and his debts are great. The baths echo with voices, steam carrying secrets as easily as the marble carries heat. A priest lifts his arms to Jupiter and the crowd lifts their arms to bread. A merchant swears his fish came fresh from Ostia though the smell is older than Neptune. My brother speaks philosophy in the portico yet wagers coin on dice in the alley. The augur points to the sky and finds fortune in birds; the farmer points to his field and finds ruin in weeds. Children chalk games on the paving stones and chariots grind them away by dusk. A gladiator polishes his helmet in the sun while a senator polishes his words in the shade. The baker sells bread for two coins at dawn and three by dusk, and still the crowd waits. Wine flows cheaper than water yet the tavern-keeper waters the wine and calls it divine. My cousin waits three days for trial while the tribune proclaims justice swift as Mercury. A poet sings verses at the temple steps but only the pigeons applaud. The amphora cracks, oil floods the market, curses rise louder than prayers. Garum perfumes the alleys, sweet to some, foul to others, eternal to all.

The baths draw every man, rich or poor. In the caldarium they argue about war, in the tepidarium about taxes, in the frigidarium about love. Sandals vanish and no man admits it. A senator reclines in the apodyterium speaking of duty while his slave rubs oil into his back. My neighbor swears he saw a god in the steam though it was only the baker’s son carrying towels. A thief slips through the crowd like smoke, taking rings and leaving only echoes. A merchant speaks of Egypt, of linen and spice, of crocodiles that swallow men whole. A sailor tells tales of storms, pirates, harbors, all ending with the price of grain. A blacksmith hammers bronze into beauty and curses iron that bends wrong. The shoemaker promises sandals that last a lifetime and the straps break in a week. A mother prays to Isis for her child’s health and the child coughs again. A beggar sings at the temple gate, collecting more coin than the priest within. A scribe copies contracts, letters, curses, poems, his hand steady while his eyes dream of freedom.

The Forum is a storm of voices. Petitions rise, accusations fall, promises scatter. Senators boast of law, clients boast of loyalty, orators boast of breath. A farmer offers figs and is cheated on weight. A lawyer speaks of justice and pockets coin with the other hand. A fortune-teller throws knucklebones and declares Rome eternal while her cup waits for coin. Boys chase dogs, dogs chase scraps, men chase power. The statues watch, marble eyes blind to all. My sandals wear thin pacing from rostra to stall, from temple to tavern. A thief carves his name into the wall, a poet carves his into verse, a soldier carves his into shields.

The circus is thunder. Horses strain, wheels rattle, dust rises like incense. The crowd cheers victory, cheers lions, cheers blood, cheers anything louder than hunger. Banners flap, trumpets blare, gamblers shout odds, lovers whisper vows. A gladiator raises his sword to Mars and the crowd raises hands to mercy or death. A boy drops his bread in the rush and a beggar snatches it faster than any lion. My voice grows hoarse from shouting yet tomorrow I will shout again. The emperor sits beneath awnings while the sun burns the common man. A charioteer dies on the sand and the crowd forgets him by dusk.

The temples smell of incense and oil. Priests chant to Juno, to Jupiter, to Mars, to Venus. A drunk staggers in and calls his prayer as loud as theirs. A sacrifice bleeds on the altar while a tax scroll bleeds my purse. A priestess sings to Apollo and her voice rises higher than the columns. A woman lays flowers before Vesta, a man lays coin before Mercury, a soldier lays vows before Mars. The gods watch or sleep or laugh. A storm cracks thunder and the augur calls it a blessing. A famine dries the fields and the augur calls it a test. A plague sweeps the streets and the augur calls it fate.

The streets choke with carts, curses, dust, laughter, vendors. A man sells amulets of bronze, another sells amulets of clay, both swear they will protect against evil eye. A woman sells perfumes that smell of roses, another sells vinegar that smells the same. A child cries for bread, a dog whines for bone, a man begs for coin. My purse grows lighter each turn of the street. The cobbler hammers nails, the smith hammers iron, the builder hammers stone. Arches rise, houses collapse, walls are painted, walls are defaced. A poet scrawls verses and a soldier scrawls oaths beside them. A baker curses flour that is too coarse, a miller curses grain that is too dear, a farmer curses rain that never comes.

The countryside is quiet but not silent. Shepherds sing, dogs bark, crows wheel. The villa walls echo laughter, arguments, orders. Slaves till fields, masters count harvests, neighbors measure boundaries. Olives grow heavy, vines sag with grapes, figs rot sweetly on the ground. A storm sweeps hills and floods fields, the farmer prays and curses both at once. A traveler passes with tales of war, another passes with tales of trade. Roads stretch beyond sight, milestones mark distances, ditches fill with weeds. Rome is far yet Rome is always near.

The army marches beyond mountains, beyond rivers. Centurions bark, legionaries tramp, eagles glint in sun. Campfires flicker, dice rattle, letters are written on wax tablets. A soldier swears he will return to his wife, another swears he will return to his wine, another swears nothing at all. Battles roar, silence falls, survivors return or they do not. The Senate praises victories, hides defeats, promises more. Veterans limp through streets with scars for medals and empty purses for rewards. Boys watch and dream of glory, mothers watch and dream of peace.

The taverns never sleep. Wine spills, voices rise, fists fall. A man boasts he fought in Gaul, another boasts he fought in Britain, both fought only their thirst. A woman sings for coin, a thief watches purses, a gambler watches dice. Lamps flicker, shadows lengthen, secrets slip. My brother wagers again though his debts already drown him. A sailor drinks to forget storms, a soldier drinks to forget war, a merchant drinks to forget taxes. At dawn the tavern still hums though the city stirs for bread.

Walls hold words no one admits to writing. Curses, prayers, boasts, loves, obscenities, all carved or scrawled. I scratched my name beside a stranger’s and wonder if centuries will see us both. One wall praises Caesar, another curses him. One wall boasts of conquest, another boasts of passion. Stone remembers what men try to hide.

Garum pours eternal. Amphorae crack, merchants argue, wives curse, neighbors gag. Some call it nectar of Neptune, some call it rot of Hades, all call it Rome. Bread remains dear, oil remains dearer, incense always demanded. Taxes rise, promises rise, tempers rise.

The empire stretches farther than eyes, farther than dreams. Legions march where no farmer walks. Roads pave mountains, ships cross seas, merchants carry silk, spices, slaves, lies. Rome swallows all, Rome hungers still. My street is cracked, my roof leaks, my sandals wear, yet they say Rome is eternal. Perhaps it is, perhaps it is not.

The Senate whispers, the Forum shouts, the circus thunders, the temples sing, the taverns roar, the baths echo, the streets never rest. Rome is a chorus, Rome is a clamor, Rome is a chain of voices unbroken. I am one voice among many, one name among walls, one coin among purses, one prayer among thousands. Rome remembers, Rome forgets, Rome endures, Rome consumes.
I just came back from the market and the price of bread is climbing again. I swear yesterday a loaf was two asses and today it is three. The baker tells me the millers blame the farmers, the farmers blame the gods, and the gods blame no one. I walked away with half a loaf and still my purse is lighter than I like.

I went down to the Forum to see what all the noise was about. The orators were shouting over each other again, promising peace, promising cheap grain, promising new roads. I heard one man praise the Senate as if they were gods and another man curse them as if they were thieves. I just stood there listening, knowing none of their words will fill my stomach.

Someone scratched another curse on the wall near my insula. I saw my neighbor laughing as he read it. I laughed too and added my name beside it, just to see if someone would notice. I wonder if anyone will ever read these walls when we are gone.

I walked to the baths this morning and found them more crowded than usual. The steam was thick, the air was loud, and every man was talking about politics. I sat in the caldarium and listened. One man swore the army is winning in the east, another swore the army is losing in the north, and I swore to myself that both were lying. My sandals disappeared again, and I walked home with a mismatched pair.

The tavern was full last night. I drank more wine than I should have, though it was watered down so thin it might as well have been from the Tiber. I lost two coins on dice. The man beside me claimed he fought in Gaul, but I could see by his soft hands he never left the city. I smiled and let him talk, because sometimes lies are better than silence.

I saw a procession for the gods today. Priests carried incense, women carried flowers, children carried nothing but smiles. I stood at the edge of the crowd and offered a prayer to Mercury to guard my purse. Later, I found my purse lighter anyway. I suppose Mercury was listening to someone else.

The circus roared this afternoon. The chariots flew around the track, wheels clattering like thunder. I cheered for the Reds though I do not know why. My throat grew raw from shouting and dust filled my mouth, but I forgot my troubles for a little while. A man beside me collapsed from the heat, and no one noticed until the race was over.

My neighbor swears his olives are cursed because the jars cracked in storage. He went to an augur to ask the cause. The augur waved at the sky and muttered about Jupiter’s anger. I told him it was just poor clay, but he prefers to believe in gods rather than cracks.

I passed by a soldier limping through the street. He showed his scar to anyone who would look, hoping for coin or sympathy. I gave him neither, though I pitied him. He said he fought for Rome, but Rome rarely fights for him.

I bought garum yesterday, a whole amphora because my wife demanded it. The smell fills the house, strong and sharp. She says it makes every dish taste divine. I say it makes every dish taste like fish guts. Still, I eat what is set before me.

The aqueduct stands tall above us, and I often stop to stare at it. The arches seem to touch the sky, carrying water from places I will never see. When I drink from the fountain I think of mountains, springs, hills, all feeding my lips. It feels like a gift from the gods, though I know it is the work of men.

A poet stood in the square reciting verses to anyone who would listen. His voice was strong, but the crowd was thin. I tossed him a coin because I liked his words about love, though I do not know if he believed them himself. I wonder who will remember his lines when his voice is gone.

I heard a woman crying in the street today. She said her husband was taken by debt collectors and she has nothing left. People walked past her as if she were a ghost. I wanted to stop, but what could I give her except pity?

The smith near my insula curses his hammer every day. I hear him from dawn until dusk, pounding iron, cursing fire, swearing at sparks. He makes fine tools, though his temper is sharper than his blades. I sometimes wonder if the gods gave him strength only so he could curse louder.

At the tavern tonight a sailor told a story of pirates. He swore by Neptune that he fought them off with nothing but an oar. I doubted every word, but I laughed and drank with him anyway. His story was better than the watered wine.

The walls near the Forum are full of words. Some praise Caesar, some curse him, some declare love, some shout obscenities. I traced my fingers over the letters and wondered how many voices speak through stone. I scratched my own small mark beside them, though no one will know it was mine.

My brother says philosophy is the true path to wisdom, but he spends more time gambling with dice than reading scrolls. He lectures me about virtue while hiding his debts. I listen politely because he is my brother, but I trust dice more than his words.

The baker raised his prices again, and I heard the crowd muttering in anger. Someone shouted that the gods punish us, someone else shouted that the Senate robs us. I think both are true. Still, I bought my bread because hunger leaves no room for pride.

In the baths a magistrate whispered of bribes while a merchant boasted of profit. I sat silently between them, pretending not to hear. I wonder how many secrets float away with the steam, rising to the ceiling like prayers.

The circus returned with lions today. The beasts roared, the crowd roared louder, and the gladiators bled in the sand. I watched one man beg for mercy and saw the emperor raise his hand. The man lived, but I do not know for how long. I left with dust in my mouth and heaviness in my chest.

I prayed at the temple this morning. I offered a coin to Mercury and a candle to Venus. I asked for fortune and for love, though I do not expect either. I think the gods listen only when it amuses them.

The cobbler near my street swore his sandals would last a lifetime. I wore them for a week before the straps broke. I returned to complain, and he swore the gods must have cursed me. I think he cursed his own work.

I saw a legion march out of the city today. Their shields gleamed, their steps thundered, their banners snapped in the wind. I cheered with the crowd, but in my heart I wondered how many would return.

The tavern grew loud again tonight. A man swore Rome will conquer the world, another swore Rome will collapse tomorrow, and both drank until they could not stand. I sat quietly, sipping what little wine I could afford, and thought how both might be right.

I often wonder if anyone will remember me. My name is scratched on a wall, my voice is lost in the crowd, my footsteps vanish in the dust. I am one among thousands, yet I still write, still speak, still live.
I walked to the Forum today and the baker raised the price of bread again. I swear the loaves grow smaller while his purse grows larger. I shouted at him but still I paid, because hunger shouts louder than I do.

The Senate promised grain from Sicily last month. I still see no ships. I only see men boasting on the rostra. I asked one senator’s client if the grain will ever arrive and he only laughed. I do not laugh when my stomach is empty.

I sat in the baths this morning and listened to a merchant tell lies about Egypt. He said the crocodiles are tame and the priests walk on water. I asked him if his wife believes his tales. He turned red and left. I remained in the steam and enjoyed my victory.

I bought garum yesterday. My wife cursed the smell. I told her it is the taste of Rome. She told me the taste of Rome belongs outside her house. I left the amphora in the alley until she calmed down.

A soldier at the tavern swore he fought in Gaul. I asked him why his only scar was on his lip. He said Gaul bites hard when it kisses. I laughed so hard I spilled my wine. He made me pay for another cup.

The circus grows louder each week. I went with my cousin and we both lost coin on the Green faction. My cousin swore never to bet again but I know he will. I swore the same and I know I will too.

The augur said the omens were good today. I saw a crow drop dung on a senator’s cloak and I said the omens were better than ever. The senator did not laugh.

I saw boys scratch their names on a wall near the Subura. I scratched mine beside theirs. I wonder if anyone centuries from now will care that I once lived.

I argued with my neighbor about olives. He says the gods cursed his harvest. I said perhaps the gods cursed his laziness. He threw a pit at me. I threw two back. We laughed and drank wine together afterward.

My brother prays loudly to Mars in the street and quietly to Venus in the night. I told him the gods hear him both ways. He told me the gods care less than the tax collector. I could not argue.

I lost my sandals in the baths again. Every time I go in with one pair and leave with another. Perhaps this is the true trade of Rome. I have decided to wear mismatched sandals proudly.

I heard a scribe complain about copying love letters. He said he knows more secrets than the gods. I told him to write his own. He said no one pays for his words. I gave him a coin and told him to write mine. He wrote only “hungry.”

A baker in the Forum gave me bread that was stale. I told him it was harder than a senator’s heart. He told me senators pay in coin and I pay in curses. I bit the bread anyway.

The aqueduct arches above us like a god carved from stone. I walked beneath it and wondered if it will stand longer than Rome itself. My neighbor said the stones are stronger than the men who built them. I think he is right.

I drank wine yesterday so thin I could see the bottom of the cup. I told the tavern keeper I could drink the Tiber for cheaper. He told me the Tiber does not sing. I told him neither does his wine.

I prayed at the temple of Mercury for luck. I prayed at the temple of Jupiter for justice. I prayed at the temple of Vesta for peace. I returned home and found none of the three.

I passed the Forum today and heard a lawyer speak so long that pigeons built a nest above him. When he finally finished, the client was asleep. I clapped anyway.

My wife scolded me for wasting coin on dice. I told her Fortuna smiles on me. She told me Fortuna laughs at me. I rolled the dice to prove her wrong. Fortuna laughed again.

I bought a small idol of Hercules for my house. My neighbor said it was carved from cheap wood. I said strength comes from belief. The idol fell over that night. I am not discouraged.

I walked by the circus at dawn. The sand was red from yesterday’s games. I thought of the gladiators who bled there and I wondered if anyone remembers their names. I only remember the crowd shouting louder than the dying.

I passed a man selling charms against the evil eye. I bought one though I do not believe. I wear it now and I feel safer. Perhaps belief is not required if fear is strong enough.

I asked the augur how long Rome will last. He told me Rome will last as long as bread is baked and wine is poured. I told him my baker cheats me and my tavern keeper waters my cup. He shrugged and said then Rome is already dying.
